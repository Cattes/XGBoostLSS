## Release version "0.2.0" (18.05.2023)

### Enhanced Distributional Modeling with PyTorch

- XGBoostLSS now fully relies on PyTorch distributions for distributional modeling.
- The integration with PyTorch distributions provides a more comprehensive and flexible framework for probabilistic modeling and uncertainty estimation.
- Users can leverage the rich set of distributional families and associated functions offered by PyTorch, allowing for a wider range of modeling options.

### Automatic Differentiation 

- XGBoostLSS now fully leverages PyTorch's automatic differentiation capabilities.
- Automatic differentiation enables efficient and accurate computation of gradients and hessians, resulting in enhanced model performance and flexibility.
- Users can take advantage of automatic differentiation to easily incorporate custom loss functions into their XGBoostLSS workflows.
- This enhancement allows for faster experimentation and easier customization.

### Hyper-Parameter Optimization
- XGBoostLSS now enables the optimization of all XGBoost hyperparameters for enhanced modeling flexibility and performance.
